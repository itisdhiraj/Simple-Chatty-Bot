<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>At this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot. ItÂ will greet you by your name.</p>

<p>Your program must print the following lines:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, {your_name}!</code></pre>

<p>You may change the name and the creation year of your bot if you want.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>{your_name}</code>, the bot must print your name entered from the standard input.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a dialogue with the bot. Input lines are started with "&gt;" symbol. You do not need to read this symbol.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
&gt; Max
What a great name you have, Max!</code></pre>

<p>Use the provided template to simplify your work. You can change the text, but not the number of printed lines.</p>
